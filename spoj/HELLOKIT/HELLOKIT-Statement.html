<p style="text-align: justify;">Kitty sends a kind of original email messages to her friend Garf. To write a message, she<br>chooses a word W and a number n and replicates W n times horizontally. Then she repeats this<br>string in the next line, but rotating the characters once to the left. And she repeats this 'rotate-<br>and-output' process until the word W appears displayed as the rst column of the rectangular<br>pattern that she produces.<br>As an example, when she chooses the word Hello and the number 3, she gets the pattern:</p> 
<p style="text-align: center;"><br>HelloHelloHello<br>elloHelloHelloH<br>lloHelloHelloHe<br>loHelloHelloHel<br>oHelloHelloHell</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br>Kitty has been sending such emails during the last three years. Recently, Garf told her that<br>perhaps her work may be automatized with a software to produce Kitty's patterns. Could you<br>help her?</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>The input le contains several test cases, each one of them in a separate line. Each test case<br>has a word and a positive integer that should generate the corresponding rectangular pattern.<br>The word is a string of alphabetic characters (a..z). The number is less than 10.<br>A line whose contents is a single period character means the end of the input (this last line<br>is not to be processed).</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Output texts for each input case are presented in the same order that input is read. For each<br>test case the answer must be a left aligned Kitty pattern corresponding to the input.</p> 
<h3>Example</h3>
